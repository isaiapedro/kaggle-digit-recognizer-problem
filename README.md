## How to Run

<br>

With Docker installed, run Docker Desktop and the jupyter notebook image with the following command

<br>

```
docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8888 -v "${pwd}:/tf/notebooks" tensorflow/tensorflow:latest-jupyter
```
## Introduction

This repository was made to solve *Digit Recognizer* on [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer).

<br/>

**A brief explanation of the problem:**

> In this competition, your goal is to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images.

<br/>

This work have the objective of completing the challenge with the best precision possible and take a first hands-on look into Convolutional Neural Networks and Computer Vision

## Data Overview



## Results



## Conclusion

Thanks for reading up until here. I had a ton of fun doing this notebook and got a lot of useful insights on Convolution and how to setup a Neural Network with three hidden layers that acts like filters.
